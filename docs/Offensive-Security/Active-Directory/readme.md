### **INTRODUCTION**

Active Directory (AD) is a service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It provides a wide array of services essential for managing network resources, user data, and application-specific data within an enterprise. The core components of AD include Domain Services (AD DS), Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), Certificate Services (AD CS), Federation Services (AD FS), and Rights Management Services (AD RMS).

### **Active Directory Structure**

1.  Domains: A domain is a collection of objects, such as users or devices, that share a common database.
2.  Trees: Groups of domains linked by a shared hierarchical structure.
3.  Forests: The top layer, representing multiple trees interconnected through trust relationships.

### **Key Concepts in Active Directory**

1.  Directory: Houses all information pertaining to Active Directory objects.
2.  Object: Represents entities within the directory, including users, groups, or shared folders.
3.  Domain: Acts as a container for directory objects. Multiple domains can coexist within a forest, each maintaining its own object collection.
4.  Tree: A grouping of domains that share a common root domain.
5.  Forest: The highest level of the organizational structure in Active Directory, composed of several trees with trust relationships among them.

### **Services Provided by Active Directory Domain Services**

1.  Domain Services: Centralizes data storage and manages interactions between users and domains, including authentication and search functionalities.
2.  Certificate Services: Oversees the creation, distribution, and management of secure digital certificates.
3.  Lightweight Directory Services: Supports directory-enabled applications through the LDAP protocol.
4.  Directory Federation Services: Provides single-sign-on capabilities to authenticate users across multiple web applications in a single session.
5.  Rights Management: Assists in safeguarding copyright material by regulating its unauthorized distribution and use.
6.  DNS Service: Crucial for the resolution of domain names.

### **Common Active Directory Vulnerabilities**

1.  Weak Password Policies: Weak password policies involve the use of simple, easily guessable passwords that do not adhere to best practices for complexity and length.
2.  Unpatched Software and Systems: Outdated software and systems with unpatched vulnerabilities are common entry points for attacker.
3.  Excessive Privileges: Users with more access rights than necessary can create significant security risks if their accounts are compromised.
4.  Inadequate Monitoring and Logging: Without adequate monitoring and logging, suspicious activities and potential breaches can go unnoticed.
5.  Lack of Network Segmentation: A lack of network segmentation allows attacker to move laterally within the network easily.
6.  Phishing Attacks and Social Engineering: Phishing and social engineering attacks trick users into divulging credentials or installing malware.
7.  Misconfigured Service Accounts: Service accounts often have high privileges, and misconfigurations can create significant security risks.
8.  Insecure LDAP Bindings: Unencrypted LDAP bindings can expose AD to credential theft and other attacks.
