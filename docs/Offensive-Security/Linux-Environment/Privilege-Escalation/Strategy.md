#### **1. Run Scripts and Analyze Enumeration Results**

- [ ] Run LinPEAS,LinEnum, lse.sh If scripts fail, refer to manual enumeration commands available in the System Enumeration section.

- [ ] Carefully review the output of your enumeration scripts and manual commands.
- [ ] Focus on high-value targets such as outdated software, misconfigurations, sensitive files, and open ports.
#### **2. Create a Checklist**
- [ ] Create a checklist of potential privilege escalation vectors based on your enumeration results.
- [ ] Avoid getting lost in rabbit holes by prioritizing tasks and focusing on the most promising leads.
#### **3. Search Key Directories**
    
- [ ] Search for files in your home directory and other common locations such as /var/backup, /tmp, /etc, and /opt.
- [ ] Check user’s history files (~/.bash_history, ~/.zsh_history, ~/.mysql_history) for useful information like commands or passwords.
#### **4. Try Simple Methods First**
    
- [ ] Focus on methods that require fewer steps:
- [ ] Sudo Privileges: Check if your user has any sudo privileges using sudo -l. Look for commands that can be executed without a password.
- [ ] Cron Jobs: Look for scheduled tasks that might be exploitable using crontab -l and inspecting /etc/crontab, /etc/cron.d, and /var/spool/cron.
- [ ] SUID Files: Identify and exploit SUID files for privilege escalation with find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null.
- [ ] World-Writable Files and Directories: Identify world-writable files and directories with find / -writable ! -path "*/proc/*" -type d 2>/dev/null.
#### **5. Investigate Root Processes**
    
- [ ] Enumerate the versions of root processes and search for known exploits. Use ps aux | grep root to identify running root processes.
- [ ] Cross-reference identified software versions with public exploit databases like Exploit-DB
#### **6. Network Enumeration**
    
- [ ] Identify network interfaces and IP addresses using ifconfig or ip a.
- [ ] Check active connections and listening ports with netstat -an -p TCP, netstat -ltp, or lsof -i.
- [ ] Check for internal ports that might be forwarded to your attacking machine for further exploitation.
#### **7. Review and Rethink**
    
- [ ] If you still haven’t achieved root access, re-read your enumeration dumps and highlight anything unusual.
- [ ] Look for unfamiliar process or file names, uncommon filesystem configurations, or odd usernames.
- [ ] As a last resort, consider kernel exploits if no other method works.

#### **General Tips**

1.  Stay Calm and Focused: Privilege escalation is often a multi-step process that requires careful attention to detail.
2.  Be Patient: Results may not be immediate. Take your time to analyze and understand the environment.
3.  Keep Notes: Document your findings meticulously. A small piece of information might become crucial later.
4.  Use Multiple Tools: Different tools might reveal different information. Cross-reference findings from tools like winPEAS, Seatbelt, and manual commands.
5.  Focus on Quick Wins: Identify and exploit low-hanging fruits such as weak permissions, misconfigured services, and stored credentials.
6.  Be Ready to Adapt: If an initial approach fails, reassess the situation and be prepared to try alternative methods.
