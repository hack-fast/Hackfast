### **FILE PERMISSIONS IN LINUX**

The concept of permissions and ownership is crucial in Linux. On a Linux system, each file and directory is assigned access rights for the owner of the file, the members of a group of related users, and everybody else.

### **OWNERSHIP TYPES**

- **OWNER**: The Owner permissions apply only to the owner of the file or directory.
- **GROUP**: The Group permissions apply only to the group that has been assigned to the file or directory.
- **OTHER USERS**: The other usersâ€™ permissions apply to all other users on the system that are not the owner, nor part of the group.
