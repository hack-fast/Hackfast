### **Introduction**

Telnet is a protocol used for remote text-based communication over a network. While it provides terminal access similar to SSH, ==Telnet transmits data in plaintext==, making it inherently insecure and prone to interception.


### **Telnet Enumeration Techniques**

Use following commands to discover and inspect Telnet services:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `telnet [IP-ADDRESS] [PORT]` | Starts a Telnet session for banner grabbing and initial reconnaissance. |
| `nmap -p 23 [TARGET-IP]` | Checks if the default Telnet port (23) is open. |
| `nmap -n -sV -Pn --script "*telnet*" -p 23 [TARGET-IP]` | Detects service version and runs Telnet-specific NSE scripts for deeper analysis. |

### **Brute-Forcing Telnet Credentials**

Hydra can be used to test credentials under various scenarios:

| Scenario | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown User | `hydra -L user.txt -p "Password" -f [TARGET-IP] telnet` |
| Unknown Password | `hydra -l user -P /opt/rockyou.txt -f [TARGET-IP] telnet` |
| Unknown User and Password | `hydra -L user.txt -P /opt/rockyou.txt -f [TARGET-IP] telnet` |
| Different Port | `hydra -l user -P /opt/rockyou.txt -f [TARGET-IP] telnet -s 9999` |

### **Automating Exploitation with Metasploit**

Metasploit offers modules for both scanning and exploiting Telnet services:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `msfconsole, search telnet, use exploit/[MODULE-PATH], set RHOSTS [TARGET-IP], run` | Runs a Telnet exploit module from Metasploitâ€™s library. |
| `msfconsole, use auxiliary/scanner/telnet/telnet_version, set RHOSTS [TARGET-IP], run` | Identifies Telnet service version and potential vulnerabilities. |

### **Key Configuration Files**

These files control how Telnet operates on a system:

| File Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/inetd.conf` | Configuration file for services controlled by `inetd`, including Telnet. |
| `/etc/xinetd.d/telnet` | Telnet-specific config for systems using `xinetd` as the service manager. |
| `/etc/xinetd.d/stelnet` | Configuration for "secure Telnet" (stelnet), if present. Used for encrypted connections. |
