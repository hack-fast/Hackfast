### **Introduction**

RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is a Microsoft-developed protocol that allows users to connect and interact with another computer remotely. It provides a graphical interface, transmitting the user's display and inputs securely over a network. RDP is commonly used for remote computer management, IT support, and accessing work applications from afar. It's primarily used with Windows but is available for other operating systems as well.

### **RDP Access and Authentication Commands**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `rdesktop -u [USERNAME] -p [PASSWORD] [TARGET-IP]` | Starts a basic RDP connection, enabling desktop access with login credentials. |
| `xfreerdp /v:[TARGET-IP] /u:'USERNAME' /p:'PASSWORD' /drive:[NAME],[PATH]` | Establishes an RDP session with resource redirection, allowing local drives to be accessible during the remote session. Useful for transferring files between the host and the client. |
| `xfreerdp /u:'USERNAME' /d:[DOMAIN] /pth:[NTLM] /v:[SERVER].[DOMAIN].local` | Connects to an RDP session using Pass-the-Hash authentication. This method uses NTLM hashes instead of plain text passwords. |

??? info "Tips & tricks"

    You can log into the RDP server without a password to gather information, such as the Windows version, from the login page.

### **FreeRDP Connection Scenarios**

| Command | Scenario |
| --- | --- |
| `xfreerdp /u:[USERNAME] /p:[PASSWORD] /v:[TARGET-IP] /sound:sys:alsa` | Connect to a FreeRDP server and activate audio output redirection using sys:alsa device |
| `xfreerdp /v:[TARGET-IP] /u:[USERNAME] /p:[PASSWORD] /dynamic-resolution` | Connect to a FreeRDP server with dynamic resolution |
| `xfreerdp /v:[TARGET-IP] /u:[USERNAME] /p:[PASSWORD] +clipboard` | Connect to a FreeRDP server with clipboard redirection |
| `xfreerdp /v:[TARGET-IP] /u:[USERNAME] /p:[PASSWORD] /cert:ignore` | Connect to a FreeRDP server ignoring any certificate checks |
| `xfreerdp /v:[TARGET-IP] /u:[USERNAME] /p:[PASSWORD] /drive:path/to/directory,share_name` | Connect to a FreeRDP server with a shared directory |

### **Brute-Forcing RDP Credentials**

| Scenario | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown User | `hydra -L user.txt -p "Password" -f rdp://[TARGET-IP]` |
| Unknown Password | `hydra -l user -P /opt/rockyou.txt -f rdp://[TARGET-IP]` |
| Unknown User and Password | `hydra -L user.txt -P /opt/rockyou.txt -f rdp://[TARGET-IP]` |

### **Nmap NSE Scripts**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ls -la /usr/share/nmap/scripts \| grep "rdp"` | Lists available Nmap scripts that target RDP services, ideal for identifying potential security enhancements or vulnerabilities. |
| `nmap --script rdp-enum-encryption -p 3389 [IP_ADDRESS]` | Enumerates encryption methods supported by the RDP server, providing insights into the security level of the RDP connections. |
| `nmap --script rdp-vuln-ms12-020 -p 3389 [IP_ADDRESS]` | Checks for the notorious MS12-020 vulnerability, which if present, could allow unauthorized remote code execution on the RDP server. |
