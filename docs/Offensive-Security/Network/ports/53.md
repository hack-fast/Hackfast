### **Introduction**

DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-friendly domain names (e.g., `www.example.com`) into IP addresses (e.g., `192.0.2.1`) that machines use to communicate. Acting as the internet’s phone book, DNS enables users to access websites using names instead of IPs. It's built on a distributed, hierarchical system of servers to handle queries efficiently.

### **Basic DNS records lookup**

Tools and commands for retrieving DNS record information.

| Tool      | Example Command                                | Description |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| nslookup  | `nslookup -type=A example.com`                 | Queries a DNS server for A records (IPv4 addresses) or other types. |
| dig       | `dig A example.com @ns1.example.com`           | Powerful DNS querying tool ideal for debugging and automation. |
| host      | `host -t mx example.com`                       | Simple tool to fetch various DNS record types, especially mail (MX) records. |
| dnsrecon  | `dnsrecon -d example.com -t axfr`              | Python script used for DNS enumeration and zone transfer testing. |
| dnsenum   | `dnsenum example.com`                          | Perl-based tool that performs comprehensive DNS info gathering. |
| nmap      | `nmap --script "dns-*" example.com`            | Runs Nmap DNS scripts to enumerate records and potential vulnerabilities. |

### **DNS lookup commands by record type**

Query different types of DNS records to gather domain intelligence.

| Record Type   | Command                                           | Description |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| A (IPv4)      | `nslookup -type=A [DOMAIN]`<br>`dig A [DOMAIN] @[NAMESERVER]` | Fetches the IPv4 address of a domain. |
| AAAA (IPv6)   | `nslookup -type=AAAA [DOMAIN]`<br>`dig AAAA [DOMAIN] @[NAMESERVER]` | Fetches the IPv6 address of a domain. |
| PTR (Reverse) | `nslookup -type=PTR [IP_ADDRESS]`<br>`dig -x [IP_ADDRESS] @[NAMESERVER]` | Resolves an IP back to its domain name. |
| ANY           | `nslookup -type=ANY [DOMAIN]`<br>`dig ANY [DOMAIN] @[NAMESERVER]` | Attempts to return all available DNS records. |
| TXT           | `nslookup -type=TXT [DOMAIN]`<br>`dig TXT [DOMAIN] @[NAMESERVER]` | Retrieves text records used for SPF, verification, etc. |
| MX (Mail)     | `nslookup -type=MX [DOMAIN]`<br>`dig MX [DOMAIN] @[NAMESERVER]` | Identifies mail servers handling email for the domain. |

### **DNS enumeration techniques**

Gain deeper insight into domain infrastructure and potential misconfigurations.

| Technique             | Command                                    | Purpose |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| DNS lookup            | `host [DOMAIN or IP_ADDRESS]`             | Retrieves default DNS record(s) for the domain or IP. |
| Enumerate NS records  | `host -t ns [DOMAIN]`                     | Lists name servers responsible for the domain. |
| Identify MX records   | `host -t mx [DOMAIN]`                     | Lists mail servers used by the domain. |
| Zone transfer attempt | `host -l [DOMAIN] [NAME_SERVER]`          | Attempts a zone transfer from a name server (often blocked). |
| TXT record lookup     | `host -t txt [DOMAIN]`                    | Finds domain text records, including SPF and verification entries. |
| SOA record check      | `host -t soa [DOMAIN]`                    | Gets domain’s Start of Authority record. |
| CNAME record check    | `host -t cname [ALIAS]`                   | Resolves a canonical name (alias) for the domain. |
| SRV record discovery  | `host -t srv _service._protocol.domain`   | Identifies service-specific records (e.g., `_sip._tcp.example.com`). |
| DNSSEC key check      | `host -t dnskey [DOMAIN]`                 | Checks for DNSSEC support and associated public keys. |
