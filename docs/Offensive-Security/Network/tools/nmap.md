### **Overview**

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open-source tool used for network discovery and security auditing. It is widely used to identify what devices are running on a network, discover open ports, detect security risks, and map network infrastructure.

```bash
# Full TCP port scan with high rate
nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 [TARGET-IP] -oN ports.nmap

# Extract open ports as comma-separated list
cat ports.nmap | grep 'open' | awk '{ print $1 }' | awk '{print ($0+0)}' | sed -z 's/\n/,/g;s/,$/\n/'

# Run default scripts and version detection on specific ports
nmap -p [PORT,PORT,PORT] -sCV [TARGET-IP] -oN Final.nmap
```

### **Target Specification**


| Option | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     | `nmap [IP-ADDRESS]` | Scan a single IP to identify open ports and associated services. |
|     | `nmap [IP-ADDRESS] [IP-ADDRESS]` | Scan a two specified IP addresses to identify open ports and associated services. |
|     | `nmap [IP-ADDRESS/RANGE]` | Scan an entire subnet to identify open ports and associated services. |
|     | `nmap [DOMAIN-NAME]` | Scan a domain to resolve and assess services hosted publicly. |
| `-iL` | `nmap -iL [TARGETS].txt` | Import a list of targets from a file, useful for organized sequential scans. |
