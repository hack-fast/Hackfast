1. **Capture and Analyze Requests**
	- [ ] Use Burp Suite or a similar tool to intercept and analyze requests to identify the presence and nature of any CSRF tokens.
	- [ ] Document the structure of requests and identify where the CSRF token is located (e.g., in `headers`, `cookies`, or request bodies).
2. **Token Predictability and Strength**
	- [ ] Evaluate if the CSRF tokens are predictable or easily guessable by analyzing their patterns.
	- [ ] Check the entropy and randomness of the CSRF tokens. Low entropy might indicate weak tokens.
3. **Header-Based Token Manipulation**
	- [ ] If the CSRF token is included in a header, temporarily remove it from the request to see if the request is still processed.
	- [ ] Modify the token value within the header to see if the application properly validates it.
4. **Body-Based Token Manipulation**
	- [ ] For tokens included in the request body, remove the value of the CSRF token parameter and see if the request succeeds.
	- [ ] Remove both the CSRF token parameter and its value to test if the request is still valid without it.
5. **Cross-User Token Reuse**
	- [ ] Test if the same CSRF token is reused across different user accounts, which would indicate poor token management.
6. **Token Substitution**
	- [ ] Replace the CSRF token with a different value of the same length to check if the application validates the token correctly.
7. **Method Manipulation**
	- [ ] Modify the request method from `POST` to `GET` and remove the CSRF token to see if the application still processes the request.
	- [ ] For `PUT` or `PATCH` requests, append the `_method` parameter to the request body to emulate a different request method and test CSRF protection.
8. **Content-Type Handling**
	- [ ] Test if the application accepts different content types (e.g., `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `text/plain`). Modify the request body accordingly and observe the response.
	- [ ] Test with multipart/form-data content type to see if the application processes requests correctly.
9. **Referer Validation Bypass**
	- [ ] Include the following code in your CSRF PoC HTML file to bypass Referer validation:
	`<meta name="referrer" content="never">`
	- [ ] Test using a custom Referer header value to check if the application relies solely on Referer headers for CSRF protection.
