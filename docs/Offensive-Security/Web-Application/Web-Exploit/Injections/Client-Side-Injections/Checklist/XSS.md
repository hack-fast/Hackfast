1. **Basic XSS Testing**
  	- [ ] Try XSS using QuickXSS tool by theinfosecguy.
  	- [ ] Upload file using `'><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>.txt`.
  	- [ ] If script tags are banned, use `<h1>` and other HTML tags.
 	- [ ] If output is reflected back inside the JavaScript as a value of any variable, use `alert(1)`.
 	- [ ] If double quotes (") are filtered, use this payload: `/><img src=d onerror=confirm(/tushar/);>`.
 	- [ ] Upload a JavaScript payload using an image file.
 	- [ ] Change method from POST to GET to bypass filters sometimes.

2. **Tag Attribute Value**
  	- [ ] If input lands in an attribute value (e.g., `<input type="text" name="state" value="INPUT_FROM_USER">`), insert payload like `" onfocus="alert(document.cookie)"`.

3. **Syntax Encoding**
  	- [ ] Encode payload as `%3cscript%3ealert(document.cookie)%3c/script%3e`.

4. **XSS Filter Evasion**
  	- [ ] Replace `<` and `>` with HTML entities `&lt;` and `&gt;`.
  	- [ ] Use an XSS polyglot, e.g., `javascript:/*-></title></style></textarea></script></xmp><svg/onload='+/"/+/onmouseover=1/+/[*/[]/+alert(1)//'>`.

5. **XSS Firewall Bypass**
  	- [ ] Check if the firewall blocks only lowercase characters.
  	- [ ] Break firewall regex with a new line (`\r\n`).
  	- [ ] Try double encoding.
  	- [ ] Test for recursive filters.
  	- [ ] Inject anchor tags without whitespace.
  	- [ ] Bypass whitespaces using bullets.
  	- [ ] Change the request method.

6. **Test For Reflected Cross Site Scripting**
  	- [ ] Verify characters `<`, `>`, `''`, `&`, and `""` are filtered.
  	- [ ] Test with character escape sequences.
  	- [ ] Replace `<` and `>` with HTML entities `&lt;` and `&gt;`.
  	- [ ] Test payloads with both lower and upper case.
  	- [ ] Break firewall regex with a new line (`\r\n`).
  	- [ ] Use double encoding.
  	- [ ] Test with recursive filters.
  	- [ ] Inject anchor tags without whitespace.
  	- [ ] Replace whitespace with bullets.
  	- [ ] Change HTTP methods.

7. **Test For Stored Cross Site Scripting**
  	- [ ] Identify stored input parameters that reflect on the client-side.
  	- [ ] Look for input parameters on the profile page.
  	- [ ] Look for input parameters on the shopping cart page.
  	- [ ] Look for input parameters on the file upload page.
  	- [ ] Look for input parameters on the settings page.
  	- [ ] Look for input parameters on the forum or comment page.
  	- [ ] Test uploading a file with XSS payload as its file name.
  	- [ ] Test with HTML tags in various input fields.

8. **Advanced XSS Testing**
  	- [ ] Test for DOM-based XSS by examining JavaScript code handling user input.
  	- [ ] Check for XSS in third-party widgets and plugins.
  	- [ ] Test XSS in email fields by injecting payloads that can be executed in email clients.
  	- [ ] Test for XSS in mobile applications using WebView.
  	- [ ] Verify if Content Security Policy (CSP) headers are in place and effective.
  	- [ ] Use CSP bypass techniques where CSP is implemented but not correctly configured.
  	- [ ] Test for XSS via JSONP endpoints.
  	- [ ] Check if XSS can be triggered in different browser contexts (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
  	- [ ] Test for reflected and stored XSS in multi-step forms and wizards.
