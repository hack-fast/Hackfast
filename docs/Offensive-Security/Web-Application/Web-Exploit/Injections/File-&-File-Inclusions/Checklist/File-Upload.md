1. **General File Upload Testing**
    - [ ] Upload files containing payloads and observe application response.
    - [ ] Attempt to change file paths to overwrite existing system files.
    - [ ] Test the application's handling of excessively large files to prevent Denial of Service attacks.
    - [ ] Check for leakage of metadata from uploaded files.
    - [ ] Assess vulnerabilities related to the ImageMagick library (e.g., Image Tragick - CVE-2016-3714).
    - [ ] Conduct pixel flood attacks with images of high density.
    - [ ] Verify file storage location for directory traversal vulnerabilities.
    - [ ] Ensure that proper validation of file types is enforced both client-side and server-side.
    - [ ] Test for server-side code execution vulnerabilities by uploading files with executable content.
    - [ ] Check if uploaded files are securely sandboxed to prevent unauthorized access.

2. **Bypass Techniques**
    - [ ] Test null byte (`%00`) bypass for file type checks.
    - [ ] Assess the enforcement of MIME types (Content-Type bypass).
    - [ ] Test file content checking based on header bytes (Magic Byte bypass).
    - [ ] Confirm server-side enforcement of file restrictions to bypass client-side validation.
    - [ ] Verify the robustness of file extension checks against blacklisted extensions.
    - [ ] Test for Unicode vulnerabilities in file names (homographic character bypass).
    - [ ] Attempt to bypass restrictions by using double file extensions (e.g., `file.jpg.php`).
    - [ ] Test file upload functionality in various contexts within the application.
    - [ ] Utilize automated tools and scripts for comprehensive file upload security testing.
    - [ ] Review the application's code for insecure handling practices related to file uploads.

3. **Specific Attacks**
    - [ ] Test for XXE (XML External Entity) injection via file upload.
    - [ ] Attempt to upload files with malicious content triggering SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).
    - [ ] Verify file handling in different environments (e.g., Windows vs. Linux).
    - [ ] Check for stored XSS vulnerabilities by uploading files with script content in metadata.
    - [ ] Test for insecure file upload configurations in third-party libraries or plugins.

4. **Post-Upload Testing**
    - [ ] Verify if uploaded files are scanned for malware.
    - [ ] Ensure uploaded files are stored in non-executable directories.
    - [ ] Implement proper access controls on uploaded files to prevent unauthorized access.
    - [ ] Test for race conditions in file upload functionality.
