1.  **Entry Point Detection**
    - [ ] Identify potential SQL injection entry points in the application.
    - [ ] Check input fields, URL parameters, headers, cookies, and other data entry points.

2.  **Testing Techniques**
    - [ ] Test with simple characters (e.g., ', ", ;, --, /\* \*/) to see basic SQL injection response.
    - [ ] Use multiple encoding layers (e.g., URL encoding, Base64) to assess filter bypass capabilities.
    - [ ] Try merging characters to form unexpected SQL queries (e.g., `' OR 1=1 --`).
    - [ ] Perform logical testing to see how the application handles SQL logic (e.g., `AND 1=1`, `OR 1=1`).
    - [ ] Include special characters (e.g., @, #, $, ^, \*, (, )) to test input sanitization processes.
    - [ ] Test for second-order SQL injection by modifying input that is later processed in SQL queries.

3.  **Detection and Evasion**
    1. Automated SQL Injection Detection & WAF Evasion Techniques 
        - [ ] Run SQL injection scanner on all requests to detect vulnerabilities.
        - [ ] Attempt to bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAF) with advanced techniques:
        - [ ] Using Null byte before SQL query.
        - [ ] Using SQL inline comment sequence (--, /\* \*/).
        - [ ] Employ URL encoding to obfuscate malicious inputs.
        - [ ] Alternate between changing cases (uppercase/lowercase) to evade case-sensitive filters.
        - [ ] Use SQLMAP tamper scripts to automate evasion tactics.
        - [ ] Use time delays and error messages to infer SQL injection (e.g., `AND 1=BENCHMARK(10000000,MD5(1))`).
    2. Time-Based SQL Injection:
        - [ ] Oracle: Test with dbms_pipe.receive_message(('a'), 10).
        - [ ] Microsoft: Use WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'.
        - [ ] PostgreSQL: Execute SELECT pg_sleep(10).
        - [ ] MySQL: Perform SELECT sleep(10).
    3. Conditional Delays for Blind SQL Injection:
        - [ ] Oracle: SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN 'a'||dbms_pipe.receive_message(('a'), 10) ELSE NULL END FROM dual.
        - [ ] Microsoft: IF (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'.
        - [ ] PostgreSQL: SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END.
        - [ ] MySQL: SELECT IF(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE, sleep(10), 'a').
    4. Boolean-Based SQL Injection:
        - [ ] Oracle: SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN 'true' ELSE 'false' END FROM dual.
        - [ ] Microsoft: IF (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) SELECT 'true' ELSE SELECT 'false'.
        - [ ] PostgreSQL: SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN 'true' ELSE 'false' END.
        - [ ] MySQL: SELECT IF(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE, 'true', 'false').
            
    5. Error-Based SQL Injection
        - [ ] General: Inject payloads to generate SQL errors (e.g., `' OR 1=1 --, "`).

    6. General SQL Injection Testing
        - [ ] Test SQL Injection on authentication forms (`login`, `registration`).
        - [ ] Test SQL Injection on the search bar.
        - [ ] Test SQL Injection on editable characteristics (`profile updates`, `comments`).
        - [ ] Use tools like `SQLmap`, `Burp Suite`, or `Hackbar`.
        - [ ] Use Google dorks to find the SQL keywords and potential vulnerable sites.
        - [ ] Test all types of SQL Injection (`GET`, `POST`, `COOKIE`, `HEADER`).
        - [ ] Try SQL Injection with various methods like null bytes, URL encoding, case changes, and tamper scripts.
        - [ ] Try SQL Injection with SQL Time delay and conditional delays.
        - [ ] Try Boolean-based, Time-based, and Error-based SQL Injection techniques.
        - [ ] Test for out-of-band SQL injection to capture data sent to an external server.

- [ ] **Techniques**
    - [ ] Test for stacked queries (e.g., ; `DROP TABLE users;--`).
    - [ ] Check for union-based SQL injection (e.g., `UNION SELECT NULL, username, password FROM users--`).
    - [ ] Test for subqueries and nested queries.
    - [ ] Assess the application's use of parameterized queries and stored procedures.
    - [ ] Verify if error handling reveals sensitive database information.
    - [ ] Perform fuzz testing on all SQL query parameters.
