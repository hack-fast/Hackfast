### **Do things the website isn’t expecting**

| Strategy | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Unexpected Inputs | Enter special characters, long strings, and non-alphanumeric symbols into input fields to uncover injection flaws and overflow issues. |
| Parameter Tampering | Modify URL parameters and hidden form fields to test the application’s handling of unexpected values. |
| Boundary Testing | Input extreme values and unexpected data types to test for overflows and type mismatches. |
| Forced Browsing | Attempt to access restricted pages by guessing URLs and using automated tools to brute-force paths. |
| HTTP Method Manipulation | Use and test endpoints with different or unexpected HTTP methods to discover hidden functionalities or vulnerabilities. |
| Session Fixation | Manipulate and attempt to reuse session tokens to test if the application properly invalidates old sessions and prevents session hijacking. |


### **Tips for setting clear objectives**

| Tip | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Be Specific | Clearly define what aspect of the application you are testing and what vulnerabilities you are looking for. |
| Example Goal | Focus on testing feature X for SQL Injection vulnerabilities for the next 4 hours to ensure efficient and focused testing. |
| Time-Boxing | Allocate a specific amount of time for each objective to maintain focus and productivity. |
| Document Findings | Keep detailed notes on what was tested, how it was tested, and any findings or potential vulnerabilities. |
