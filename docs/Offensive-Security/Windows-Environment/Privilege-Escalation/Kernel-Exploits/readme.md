### **INTRODUCTION**

The kernel is the center of any operating system. It acts as a critical intermediary layer between application software and the physical hardware of a computer. This core component has comprehensive control over everything that happens in the system.One of the critical aspects of kernel functionality is its security; exploiting a kernel vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute commands with SYSTEM privileges, which are the highest level of rights on a computer.

??? info "IMPORTANT"

    Kernel exploits should be used as a last option. It's important to exercise caution. Kernel exploits can be unstable, potentially leading to one-off success or causing the system to crash.
