### **Introduction**

The kernel is the core of any operating system. It acts as a critical intermediary between application software and the computerâ€™s physical hardware. Because it has complete control over system operations, kernel security is crucial.  

Exploiting a kernel vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute commands with **SYSTEM privileges**, the highest level of access on a Windows system.

??? info "Important"

    Kernel exploits should always be considered a last resort.  
    They can be unstable, often leading to a one-time success or, in many cases, causing the system to crash.
