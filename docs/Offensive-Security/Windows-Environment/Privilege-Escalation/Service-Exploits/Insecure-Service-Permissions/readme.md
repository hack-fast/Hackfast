### **Introduction**

Insecure service permissions can create serious security risks in Windows environments.  
These permissions are defined through Access Control Lists (ACLs), which determine what actions users can perform on a service.

??? info "Note"

    ⚠️ Potential rabbit hole:  
    If you can modify a service configuration but do not have permission to stop/start the service, privilege escalation may fail.  
    Always confirm you have sufficient access before attempting exploitation.
